Note - Below steps assume that you have Git installed already.

1. Git init -> To initialize the Git repository in the system
2. Git add <filename> -> To add a file to the repo.
3. Git commit -m "comment" -> To commit a change to the repo.
4. Git status -> To show the status of the change implemented.
5. Git log -> Shows the versioning information for all the changes.
6. Got checkout <version number> -> To rollback the changes to an earlier version.
7. Git config --list -> To show the configuration of the Git account.

8. git remote add origin https://github.com/saurajt/DevOps.git -> Add the github account to local repo
9. git push -u origin master -> Upload the local copy to github repo. 'origin' means github. So, local copy is uploaded to github master branch. If prompted, provide the Github credentials. Refresh the Github once done to see your local repo online.

Note: You can you see the SSL certificate issue, run the command "git config --global http.sslVerify false". This will disable the SSL validation for GIT. Not a recommended step for security concerns. So, once the step is initialized, renable the SSL validation by running command "git config --global http.sslVerify true".

10. git branch -m master main -> To rename the 'master' branch as 'main' branch.
11. Once the branch is renamed, you need to re-perform steps 8 and 9 for the changes to take effect. In steps 8, change master to main while peforming here.
